# philly-district-crime
In this project, we collected data on crime incidents in 2023 in Philadelphia from opendataphilly.org. Each crime is divided into one of the 22 police districts and is defined by their type (ie. theft, robbery firearm, burglary residential). The purpose of this website is to allow the user to pick two districts from dropdown menus and compare the crime frequencies between the two. In a double bar graph, the two districtsâ€™ crime types are compared based on frequency. Our goal is to provide users accurate information about crime in Philadelphia; our city has an unfortunate reputation of being very dangerous, but is it really dangerous as everyone says it is? With the information provided, the user will be well-informed enough to create their opinion and answer the question themselves.

# Installation/Setup Instructions:

2. Displaying data in an appropriate way
    - color-blind friendly colors
    - accessible way to display bar graphs
3. Finding unbiased sources and dealing with biased sources
4. Using different articles to fit the user story we wanted to tell
5. Finding different ways to tell a user story and finding the most interesting or practical one
