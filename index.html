        <h2>In this project, we collected data on the crime
            incidents in Philadelphia in the year 2023 thus far.
            Each crime is divided into one of the 22 police districts
            and is defined by their type (ie. theft, robbery firearm,
            burglary residential). The purpose of this website is to
            allow the user to pick two districts from dropdown menus
            and compare the crime frequencies between the two. In a
            double bar graph, the two districts' crime types are compared
            based on frequency. Our goal is to provide users accurate
            information about crime in Philadelphia; our city has an
            unfortunate reputation of being very dangerous, but is it
            really dangerous as everyone says it is? With the information
            provided, the user will be well-informed enough to create their
            opinion and answer the question themselves.</h2>
